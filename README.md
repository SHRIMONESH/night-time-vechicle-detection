# 🌙 Nighttime Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8 🚗✨

This project implements a **Nighttime Vehicle Detection System** using the **YOLOv8** object detection model from Ultralytics. Designed to work in low-light conditions, the project uses Google Colab for training and inference and Google Drive for dataset management and result storage.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🚘 Detects vehicles in nighttime/low-light environments.
- ⚙️ Based on **YOLOv8 (v8.3.49)**.
- 📂 Uses **Google Drive** for persistent storage.
- ✅ System environment checks for Python, PyTorch, and CUDA.
- 🧠 Built for **Google Colab GPU runtime**.
